uber-movie-finder
=================

This is to find some movies from the SF data. This code was written in a short period of time for demo. 

Things that could be improved:
1- I did not like the json format, so I am downloding the XML and converting it to a smaller JSON to send to the fromnt end.
2- Some of the addresses are very vague, they could be processed better. Right now I just add "San Francisco" to the end of them, hopping google api would find something.
3- The UI needs some cleaning.
